# TableroPuntos-CheckMat-Brazil
This software was created and used in jiujitsu events, both in Argentina and in Curitiba Brazil. It has 4 panels (1 controller + 1 point marker + 1 advertising controller + 1 advertising panel);
Persistence through files was used for the advertisements, and both the advertisements from the advertising panel and the advertisement from the point scoreboard can be loaded/deleted. Everything is saved in an internal folder.
Windows Forms technology and C# language were used and the work was done individually.
It is designed to connect a computer with a TV via HDMI cable and set to "expand screen" mode.
